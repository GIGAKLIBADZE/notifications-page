## My process

I used different point of view when starting building of the project. I created the .json file for the data. I split off it in different components, then started to initialize each of them with respective CSS files and with using JS in it. I used mobile first workflow. For summary, I changed my mindest for with React JS for the process of building.

### Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties
Flexbox
Mobile-first workflow
JavaScript
React JS

### What I learned

After creating many HTML/CSS projects, then adding a lot of ones built with the DOM, I can confidently say that I am now completely familiar with the DOM structure and its basics. Now, I started learning of React and it is my second porject with this library. I plan to continue working on projects involving the React to deepen my understanding.

### Continued development

Already, after building a lot of DOM projects, I am going to commence learning React JS.
